## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Media Queries

### What I learned

My biggest hurdle with completing this challenge was wrapping my head around media queries. In particular, I had a heck of a time figuring out how to get a different image displayed on a smaller screen. That solution was a lot easier than I thought it would be, though! I eventually figured it all out, but I'm not sure if there's a easier way to get everything looking nice with my media queries. It all worked out how I wanted it to look, but I'm not sure if my approach could be simplified. 

I also got a bit more comfortable with properly structuring my HTML and CSS. I did away with ID tags in favor of classes, and took time to organize my CSS after I was done. Further, I moved away from using px's and instead used em/rem units.

### Continued development

I hope to keep taking on responisive challenges and get even more confident with media queries. I figured it out eventually, but it took me awhile! With more experience, I hope to be able to speed up that process a lot. For a future project, I'd also like to give mobile-first design a go.
